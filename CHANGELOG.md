# Changelog

## 0.5.4 (2026-06-23)

### New Features
- **Squash & Cherry-pick Multiple Commits** - Select consecutive commits directly in the graph (Shift-click for a range, Ctrl/Cmd-click to toggle), then right-click the selection to squash them into one or cherry-pick them all at once. Squashing opens a dialog to edit the combined commit message and warns when a force push will be required.

### Bug Fixes
- **Chrome Network Stall Fix** - Commit author avatars are now fetched and cached in the extension host and shared across windows, instead of loading from gravatar.com in each webview. This prevents the socket exhaustion that could leave Chrome unable to load pages after extended use with multiple windows.

## 0.5.3 (2026-06-21)

### New Features
- **Branch Colors by Pattern** - Assign fixed colors to branches by name pattern (`gitGraphPlus.branchColors`), so important branches always stand out in the graph. The first matching rule wins; branches matching no rule keep an automatic color.
- **Commit Signature Status** - Show GPG/SSH signature verification status next to each commit in the graph (`gitGraphPlus.showSignatureStatus`). The Commit Details panel always shows it on demand regardless of the setting.
- **Custom Graph Color Palette** - Customize the colors auto-assigned to graph rails with your own list of hex colors (`gitGraphPlus.graphColors`), defaulting to the built-in 12-color palette.

### Bug Fixes
- **Branch Color on All Nodes** - A pattern-colored branch now recolors every commit node on its rail, not just the rail line. Previously, commit nodes above the matching branch tip kept the default color while the line was recolored.

## 0.5.2 (2026-06-15)

### New Features
- **New Worktree from the Graph** - Create a worktree straight from the commit graph: a "New Worktree" entry on a branch's context menu and in the commit's "Create" group opens the Add Worktree dialog with the picked branch pre-filled as the start point (which you can still change before confirming).
- **Worktree from an Existing Branch** - When adding a worktree you can now check out an existing branch instead of always creating a new one. Branches already checked out in another worktree are filtered out, and default worktree paths are cleaner.

## 0.5.1 (2026-06-14)

### New Features
- **Worktree Open & Reveal** - Open a worktree in a new VS Code window (or just click it in the sidebar), and reveal it in the file explorer, from the Worktrees view's context menu.

### Improvements
- **Localized Worktree Commands** - The "Open Worktree" and "Open in File Explorer" actions are now translated for Korean and Chinese.
- **Consistent Graph Fonts** - Unified the monospace and header fonts in the commit graph so the SHA column and column headers render consistently.

### Bug Fixes
- **Interactive Rebase in Submodules** - Interactive rebase no longer fails with an ENOTDIR error in submodules and linked worktrees, and the paused-state banner now appears correctly.
- **Branch Badge Icons** - Only the current-branch check mark stays bold; the cloud and other badge icons now render at their normal weight.

## 0.5.0 (2026-06-10)

### New Features
- **Accessible Branch Badges** - Branch badges now carry their color in a solid left accent bar over a neutral fill, with a configurable thickness (`gitGraphPlus.branchBadgeBarThickness`), keeping branch colors legible for color vision deficiency.
- **Partial Stash Restore** - Restore only selected files or folders from a stash instead of the whole stash.
- **Folder Multi-Select** - Ctrl/Cmd-click a folder in a commit's file list to select every file within it.
- **Create Patch from Selection** - Generate a patch file from the selected commit files or folders.
- **Multi-Commit Selection & Compare** - Unified multi-commit selection with compare and per-commit diffs.
- **Configurable Modal Defaults** - Set default options for operation dialogs (push, pull, merge, rebase, and more), including optional follow-up push or cleanup after the operation.
- **Push After Rebase** - Optionally push the branch automatically after a successful rebase.

### Performance
- **Faster Commit Selection** - Reduced the click debounce to 150ms so commit details load more quickly.

### Bug Fixes
- **Multi-Line Rebase Messages** - Interactive rebase reword and squash now preserve the full multi-line commit message instead of just the subject.
- **Repository Dropdown** - Canonicalized repository paths so the dropdown stays in sync, and widened it to fit long names without wrapping.
- **Graph Isolation** - Unrelated commit graphs no longer paint over the active repository.
- **Rebase Conflict Prediction** - More accurate conflict prediction by chaining commits.
- **Delete Remote Tags** - Tags are now deleted from all remotes, not just origin.
- **Interactive Rebase on Windows** - Fixed a failure caused by cmd-shell syntax.
- **Ref Badge Focus Outline** - Removed an unwanted focus outline on ref badges after pressing Esc.

## 0.4.3 (2026-05-31)

### New Features
- **Conflict File Preview** - Merge and rebase modals now list the files predicted to conflict when you hover over the action, so you can spot trouble before running the operation.

### Bug Fixes
- **Git Error Messages** - Failed git operations now surface the remote-provided cause, explaining what actually went wrong.
- **Hover Tooltips** - Tooltips no longer cover the context menu or the color-select dropdown while either is open.

## 0.4.2 (2026-05-24)

### New Features
- **Fast-Forward Without Checkout** - You can now fast-forward a non-current branch up to its upstream without switching to it.
- **Wide Graph Horizontal Scrolling** - Commit graphs with many concurrent branches now scroll horizontally, with the author, SHA, and date columns pinned to the right.
- **Graph Auto-Pan** - As you scroll vertically, the graph pans horizontally to keep the start of the commit message in view.

### Improvements
- **Diff Syntax Highlighting** - Highlighting now follows your VS Code light/dark theme and covers many more languages (Svelte, Vue, Ruby, PHP, SCSS, Kotlin, Swift, C#, TOML, XML, and more) instead of falling back to plain text.
- **Loading Feedback** - Changing filters, refreshing, and pressing Ctrl+R now show a loading state while the graph reloads.

### Performance
- **Faster Rebase Conflict Preview** - The rebase conflict predictor now probes commits in parallel, cutting preview latency on multi-commit branches.
- **Large Diffs** - Very large diffs are now capped with an opt-in "show full diff" button so opening them no longer freezes the panel.
- **Large Repositories** - Faster commit graph rendering and initial load.
- **On-Demand Syntax Grammars** - Diff highlighting grammars load only when a file needs them, keeping the panel light.

### Bug Fixes
- **Load More Button** - Stays in view while the graph is scrolled horizontally.
- **Auto-Refresh** - The graph now refreshes on working-tree changes, and rapid file selections no longer overwrite each other's diffs.

## 0.4.1 (2026-05-21)

### Improvements
- **Modal Polish** - Spaced out the amend modal's option checkboxes, kept the message field scrollable when keeping a long message, centered the checkbox tick, and made the "no conflict" / "staged" status checkmarks a touch bolder.

### Bug Fixes
- **Large Repository Rendering** - The commit graph no longer pushes commit messages off screen or overlaps the SHA and date columns in repositories with many concurrent branches.
- **Custom Git Path** - The extension now honors the VS Code `git.path` setting, so it works when Git is not on the system `PATH` (e.g. portable or MSYS2 installs).
- **Compare View Diffs** - Clicking a file while comparing two commits (or comparing to the working tree) now shows its diff again.
- **Git LFS Warning** - Stopped showing a spurious warning when Git LFS is not installed.

## 0.4.0 (2026-05-20)

### New Features
- **Amend from Graph** - You can now amend the last commit directly from the graph's context menu or keyboard shortcuts.
- **SCM Integration for Uncommitted Changes** - Clicking the uncommitted-changes row (or the new tooltip) now automatically opens the VS Code Source Control view.
- **Rebase Conflict Prediction Limits** - The rebase conflict predictor now surfaces a 20-commit cap when the topic branch has deep history, keeping the UI responsive while providing useful feedback.

### Improvements
- **Fast-Forward Autostash** - Automatic stash popping now works correctly for fast-forward merges, matching standard pull semantics.
- **Stash and Checkout Behavior** - The 'stash and checkout' flow now correctly sets changes aside instead of carrying them over to the target branch.
- **Interactive SCM State** - Double-clicking and using the context menu on uncommitted change files is now supported.
- **Enhanced i18n** - Routed remaining hardcoded English tooltips, modal labels, and CommitDetails labels through the translation system.

### Performance
- **Unified Graph Layout** - Graph layout is now computed once per refresh, significantly reducing CPU usage on large repositories.
- **Shared Reachability Index** - Hash indices are now shared across graph reachability passes, speeding up branch/tag/stash association by up to 30%.
- **Deduplicated Data Fetching** - In-flight fetches for branches, tags, remotes, and worktrees are now deduplicated, preventing redundant git calls during rapid UI interaction.
- **Optimized Highlighting** - Large file diffs are now highlighted in chunks to maintain UI responsiveness during scroll.

### Bug Fixes
- **Improved Diff Parsing** - Diff headers and path resolution are now more robust, correctly handling `+++`/`---` lines and trailing newlines.
- **Pagination Reliability** - Fixed duplication of the UNCOMMITTED and stash rows when navigating paginated log pages.
- **Git-Flow Stability** - Hardened git-flow inputs and guarded against race conditions during diff generation.
- **Worktree Support** - Fixed conflict marker probing and gitdir resolution when working inside linked git worktrees.
- **Search Robustness** - Search handlers are now guarded with sequence counters to prevent stale results from overwriting newer queries.
- **Commit Stats Alignment** - Commit stats are now binned by the author's local time instead of the host's time.
- **Security Hardening** - Improved validation for webview-supplied paths and git payloads.
- (Plus over 20 other stability and correctness improvements)

## 0.3.12 (2026-05-17)

### Improvements
- **Stricter Git Input Validation** - File paths and search inputs are now validated against git's own rules before being passed to the CLI, preventing malformed names (paths starting with `-`, control characters in search queries, file:// remote URLs without scheme allowlist) from being misinterpreted
- **Branch/Tag Name Checks** - Names are now rejected if any slash-separated component is empty, starts with `.`, or ends with `.lock` — matching `git check-ref-format` more closely

### Bug Fixes
- **Interactive Rebase: Reword in Squash Groups** - A reword target followed by squash/fixup now honors the typed final message instead of git's combined-message default
- **Interactive Rebase: Fixup-only Group Message** - Edited target message is no longer silently dropped in fixup-only groups
- **Interactive Rebase: Order-only Changes** - The "Start Rebase" button is now enabled when only commit order has changed
- **Rebase Pause No Longer Shows Error Dialog** - When `edit` step or a conflict pauses the rebase, the redundant error dialog on top of the banner is gone — the banner alone guides next steps
- **Modals Stay Open After Operation Fails** - Failed operations now close the modal that triggered them instead of leaving it sitting open in a stale state
- **Tooltip Escape Inside Modals** - The Escape key now dismisses tooltips even when focus is trapped inside a modal
- **Closing the Panel During a Long Operation** - Closing the Git Graph+ panel while a long git operation is in flight no longer triggers errors when the result tries to post back to the (now-gone) webview
- **Sidebar Auto-refresh Overlap** - Rapid file watcher events can no longer trigger overlapping refreshes that produced inconsistent sidebar state
- **LFS Warning Noise** - Warnings for known-harmless LFS configurations (file:// remote, missing lock server) are suppressed while real failures are still surfaced
- **Windows Repo Paths with Special Characters** - Interactive rebase now works correctly when the repository path contains `&`, `|`, `%`, parentheses, etc.
- **Conflict Banner Localization** - "Merge/Rebase/Revert/Cherry-Pick Conflict" labels and the "Abort" button are now translated in Korean and Chinese

## 0.3.11 (2026-05-17)

### New Features
- **VS Code Credential Prompt on Remote Auth Failure** - When fetch/pull/push fails due to missing or invalid HTTP credentials, Git Graph+ now drives VS Code's built-in credential prompt and retries the command once

### Performance
- **Graph Rendering** - Additional speedups in commit graph rendering hot paths

### Bug Fixes
- **Phantom Rebase State** - Status banner no longer falsely reports a rebase as in progress when `REBASE_HEAD` is left behind after `rebase --continue` succeeds; the rebase state directory is now the canonical marker
- **Nested Git Repositories** - Untracked entries that are nested git repos (not registered as submodules) are now expanded and labeled distinctly instead of showing as an empty diff

## 0.3.10 (2026-05-17)

### Bug Fixes
- **Multi-repo Workspace** - Fixed sidebar and webview falling out of sync when switching repositories in a multi-repo workspace
- **Non-Git Folder** - Opening Git Graph+ in a folder without a Git repository now shows a clear "not a Git repository" message instead of a raw fatal error

- **Webview Startup** - Fixed "command not found" error when opening the extension with no workspace folder open

## 0.3.4 (2026-05-06)

### Improvements
- **Tooltip System** — Replaced unreliable native `title=` tooltips with a custom JS-based tooltip action across all UI elements (toolbar, graph, modals, reflog, search, and more)
- **Tooltip UX** — Tooltips now follow the mouse cursor, appear after a short delay, and automatically flip position when near viewport edges to avoid clipping
- **Modal Pill Truncation** — Branch name pills in modal dialogs now truncate with ellipsis when names are too long, with equal max-width distribution between source and target
- **Context Menu** — Submenus now adjust vertical position automatically when they would overflow the bottom of the viewport

### Bug Fixes
- **Multi-repo in Non-Git Root** — Fixed extension not activating correctly when the workspace root is not a Git repository; now auto-discovers and switches to the first valid Git repo on startup (closes #9)
- **Reflog Dangling Icon** — Fixed vertical alignment of the warning icon in Reflog dangling commit rows
- **Reflog Tooltip Overlap** — Dangling tooltip moved from the entire row to the warning icon to prevent double tooltip when hovering the message column
- **Interactive Rebase Pills** — Fixed missing ellipsis truncation on branch name pills in the Interactive Rebase modal

### New Features
- **Reflog search** — Real-time filtering by message or hash directly in the Reflog tab
- **Reflog filter dropdowns** — Separate dropdowns for Ref (HEAD or any branch) and Action type (commit, checkout, reset, rebase, merge, etc.)
- **Per-branch reflog** — Switch the Reflog view to any local branch to see only that branch's ref movements

- Search now matches branch names and tag names in addition to commit messages, authors, and hashes
- Column header font sizes unified across Graph and Reflog (header 11px, row 13px)

### Performance
- CommitGraph: SVG paths, links, and dots now filtered to the visible scroll range — avoids rendering thousands of off-screen elements
- CommitGraph: timed message handlers now tracked with a type-safe `Map` instead of property injection on function objects
- MainPanel: `getLog` requests are now sequenced — stale responses from rapid filter changes are discarded
- git-service: remote name cache is immediately invalidated after `addRemote`/`removeRemote`

### Bug Fixes
- Modal: guard against duplicate `onClose` calls from rapid Escape keypresses
- Suppress expected `rev-parse` failures (MERGE_HEAD, REBASE_HEAD probes) from the activity log on clean repos

### Improvements
- **Set upstream modal UX**: Improved layout and interaction flow for the set upstream modal
- **Conflict status labels**: Merge, rebase, cherry-pick, and revert conflict status messages now include the operation name for clarity
- **Conflict status font size**: Conflict status text in action modals aligned to 12px to match button text

- **Git flag badges**: Modal option labels show the underlying git flag (e.g. `--no-ff`, `--squash`) for transparency

### Improvements
- **Live settings refresh**: `graphSortOrder` and `maxCommits` changes apply immediately without reloading the panel
- **VS Code notifications**: Operation success/failure toasts now use native VS Code notifications instead of in-webview banners
- **Stash ref hidden in commit details**: REFS row is no longer shown for stash commits in the bottom panel (redundant with graph badge)

### Bug Fixes
- **Checkout stash restore**: If checkout or create-branch fails after auto-stash, the stash is now always popped back (previously changes could be left stuck in stash)
- **Flow action validation**: Invalid `flowType` or `action` values now surface as errors instead of silently reporting success
- **Conflict operation type**: `refreshConflicts` no longer defaults to `merge` when no operation is active, preventing a stale conflict banner
- **Interactive rebase dropdown opacity**: Fixed visual regression where action dropdowns appeared faded
- **Load more scroll position**: Scroll position is now preserved when loading additional commits
- **Status bar visibility**: Status bar item is now correctly shown/hidden based on panel state

## 0.2.6 (2026-04-23)

### New Features
- **Graph sort order setting**: Added `gitGraphPlus.graphSortOrder` configuration (`date` / `topological`). Default is `date` (`--date-order`) so commits are sorted chronologically across branches

### Bug Fixes

- **Root commit diff**: First commit in the repository now correctly shows all added files in the file list
- **Toolbar separators**: Fetch, pull, and push buttons now have separators between them, consistent with the rest of the toolbar

## 0.2.5 (2026-04-22)

### New Features
- **Publish branch button**: Branches with no upstream now show a `cloud-upload` icon (green) in the webview toolbar; clicking it opens the push modal with upstream setup
- **Sidebar buttons open webview modals**: Fetch, pull, and push buttons in the branches view toolbar now open the same confirmation modals as the webview toolbar

### Improvements
- **External conflict detection**: Merge/rebase conflicts triggered from the terminal are now automatically detected and show the conflict resolution UI in the webview
- **Push modal label**: "Create tracking reference" renamed to "Upstream 설정 / Set upstream"
- **Stash badge color**: Stash ref badges in the commit graph changed from purple to gray

## 0.2.4 (2026-04-20)

### New Features
- **Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) localization**: Full UI translation contributed by @baiyibs

### Improvements
- **Diff toolbar fixed on scroll**: File name and inline/side-by-side toggle stay visible when scrolling horizontally
- **Diff horizontal scroll**: Entire diff scrolls as one unit instead of per-line scrollbars
- **Side-by-side diff**: Long lines no longer overlap adjacent panel
- **Bottom panel height**: Now scales with window size (default 35%, min 20%, max 70%)
- **Commit diff load time**: Diff and file list requests run in parallel, reducing latency by ~50%

### Bug Fixes
- **Auth error infinite spinner**: Loading indicator now clears immediately when authentication fails
- **Auth error messaging**: SSH vs HTTPS failures show distinct messages with actionable hints; "Show Error" button exposes raw git output

## 0.2.3 (2026-04-19)

### New Features
- **Checkout keep-changes uses 3-way merge**: "Keep changes and checkout" option now runs `git checkout --merge` so dirty working tree is carried across branch switches via 3-way merge instead of being refused by git

### Improvements
- **Checkout dirty options simplified**: 4 radio options reduced to 3 - "Keep changes and checkout" (merge), "Stash and checkout" (always `-u`), "Discard all changes". Removed the separate tracked-only stash variant to reduce decision fatigue
- **SCM sidebar polish**: Branches view opens expanded by default; pull/push title actions added next to fetch using webview-matching arrow icons; all 5 views (branches, remotes, tags, stashes, worktrees) now declare icons so they render correctly when moved between containers

### Bug Fixes
- **Side-by-side diff syntax highlighting**: Both panes now run through Shiki highlighting (previously only inline mode was highlighted - side-by-side rendered raw text)
- **Hunk headers removed**: Raw unified-diff headers (`@@ -0,0 +1,37 @@`) removed from diff view; replaced with a thin dashed separator between hunks. Line number columns provide position without the visual noise

### Tests
- Added `checkout` option tests covering `--merge`, `--force`, and default invocations (97 tests total)

## 0.2.2 (2026-04-19)

### Security
- **Ref injection hardening**: `GitService.assertSafeRef` rejects empty refs and refs starting with `-` across all methods that forward user input to `git` (checkout, branch ops, merge, rebase, interactiveRebase, cherry-pick, revert, reset, diff, show, tag, ls-tree, format-patch, log, addRemote, setUpstream, bisect, worktreeAdd, pushTag, deleteRemoteBranch/Tag)
- **Path traversal guard**: `getImageBase64` rejects absolute paths and `..` segments
- **Webview HTML escape**: i18n `t()` now escapes parameter values before placeholder substitution; pill markup moved into translation templates. Function replacer avoids `$&`/`$1` pattern interpretation in `replaceAll`

### Bug Fixes
- **View provider dispose leak**: TreeView providers now registered in `context.subscriptions` so their `dispose()` runs on deactivation
- **FileWatcher leak on repo switch**: `MainPanel.switchRepo` removes the stale `FileWatcher` from the disposables array before pushing the replacement
- **Package hygiene**: `.claude/` excluded from `.vsix` so local Claude Code settings no longer ship to the marketplace

### UI/UX
- **Modal text readability**: `.modal-desc` uses `word-break: keep-all` + `overflow-wrap: anywhere` + tighter line-height for natural Korean line wrapping; emphasized phrases no longer break mid-syllable
- **Emphasis class refactor**: Inline `style="color: ..."` replaced with `.modal-emph--danger` / `.modal-emph--info` utility classes across all translations
- **Submenu position fix**: Context submenu wrapped in `position: relative` container so `top: 0` aligns with the trigger row regardless of separators or preceding item count

### Tests
- Added 24 new `GitService` validation tests covering ref rejection (`-foo`, `--hack`, empty) and filePath traversal (94 tests total)

## 0.2.1 (2026-03-24)

- **Tag merge**: Tags now have merge option in context menu
- **Diff from compare/working tree**: Double-click files in compare or working tree view to open VS Code diff
- **Push tags to all remotes**: Tag creation pushes to all configured remotes by default

### Improvements
- **Context menu refinement**: Merge only on branch/tag commits, rebase only on non-current-branch, interactive rebase on all
- **Sidebar auto-refresh**: Sidebar tree views update after all git operations
- **Light theme readability**: Darker text colors for warnings, errors, status indicators, pills, and badges
- **Worktree icon**: Updated to codicon-worktree
- **Bottom panel height**: Max height now 70% of viewport (was 600px)

### Bug Fixes
- **Sidebar refresh race condition**: Fixed superseded doFetch preventing tree view updates (fetchId-based check)
- **FileWatcher timer leak**: Cooldown timer now tracked and cleared on dispose
- **Memory: exec() buffer**: Replaced O(n²) string concatenation with Buffer array collection
- **Memory: resize listener**: Fixed potential leak when component unmounts during drag
- **Memory: EventEmitter**: Added dispose() to all view providers
- **Theme detection**: Fixed non-reactive isLight in CommitDetails
- **Process safety**: Added timeouts to predictConflicts (15s) and getImageBase64 (30s/50MB limit)
- **Process safety**: SIGKILL fallback after SIGTERM timeout in exec()
- **Input validation**: Stash index rejects negative/non-integer values
- **Rebase temp file**: Unique filename prevents concurrent rebase collision

### Tests
- Added git-service unit tests (12 tests): stash validation, clean, pushTagToAllRemotes, setExtraEnv, activity log truncation, GitError
